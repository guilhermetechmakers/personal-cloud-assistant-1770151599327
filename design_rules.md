# Design Rules for This Project

## Project Design Pattern: ---

## Visual Style

### Color Palette:
- **Primary Background:** Deep charcoal (#18191C) used for main backgrounds and panels.
- **Secondary Background:** Slightly lighter dark gray (#232429) for cards and sub-panels.
- **Accent Color:** Vibrant blue (#3A8FFF) for highlights, active states, and icons (e.g., sidebar active item).
- **Text Colors:** 
  - Primary text: White or near-white (#F4F5F7)
  - Secondary text: Cool gray (#B0B3BC)
  - Tertiary/muted text: Dimmed gray (#6E727A)
- **Borders/Dividers:** Subtle dark gray (#26272C) for separating elements.
- **Status/Indicators:** Occasional use of soft red (#FF5B5B), yellow (#FFD66B), and green (#3DD598) for tags or indicators.
- **Card/Panel Highlights:** Slightly lighter overlays or gradients for card hovers.

### Typography & Layout:
- **Font Family:** Sans-serif (e.g., Inter, SF Pro, or similar modern geometric sans).
- **Font Weights:** 
  - Bold for headings/titles.
  - Medium or regular for body text.
  - Light for secondary or meta information.
- **Hierarchy:** Clear distinction between headings, subheadings, and body; headings are larger and bolder.
- **Spacing:** Generous padding inside cards and between sections (24px–32px gutters), tight line heights for lists.
- **Alignment:** Left-aligned content, grid-based card layout, with sidebar navigation on the left.
- **Typography Treatments:** All-caps or semi-bold for section titles; subtle letter-spacing for navigation and labels.

### Key Design Elements

#### Card Design:
- **Styling:** Rounded corners (8px radius), dark backgrounds (#232429), thin border or subtle shadow for elevation.
- **Shadows:** Low-contrast, soft shadows for subtle depth; no harsh elevation.
- **Borders:** Minimal, 1px dark line (#26272C).
- **Hover States:** Slight lightening of background, faint outer glow or shadow, and icon highlight.
- **Hierarchy:** Title at top, icon or badge left-aligned, description/body below, clear action buttons (e.g., “Connect”).

#### Navigation:
- **Sidebar:** Fixed vertical sidebar, dark base (#18191C), with icons and text.
- **Active State:** Bright accent highlight (blue #3A8FFF), filled background or pill indicator.
- **Expandable/Collapsible:** Sections like “Projects” and “Support” are collapsible, indicated by chevrons.
- **Top Bar:** Thin header with search bar and user/profile area.

#### Data Visualization:
- **Chart Style:** Minimalist, line and donut charts with accent color highlights (e.g., red/pink for trends, blue/green for pie segments).
- **Background:** Transparent or blended with card background.
- **Grid/Axis:** Light or semi-transparent grid lines, no bold outlines.
- **Labels:** Muted gray text, concise and unobtrusive.

#### Interactive Elements:
- **Buttons:** Rounded, filled or outlined styles; accent color for primary actions, muted for secondary.
- **Form Elements:** Rounded input fields, dark backgrounds, subtle border or shadow, clear focus state (blue glow).
- **Hover Effects:** Light background shift, icon color transition, subtle scaling or glow for buttons and cards.
- **Micro-interactions:** Smooth transitions on expand/collapse, search/filter activation, and navigation selection.

### Design Philosophy

This interface embodies:
- **Aesthetic Approach:** Modern, minimalist, and professional with a dark UI and subtle, purposeful use of color.
- **Design Principles:** Clarity, accessibility, and focus—prioritizing readability, quick scanning, and low cognitive load for busy professionals.
- **Visual Strategy:** Clean, distraction-free layouts with strong visual hierarchy and intuitive navigation; all elements are designed to support productivity and trust, making complex information feel approachable and manageable.

All design decisions should align with this pattern's best practices.

## General Design Principles

## Color & Visual Design

### Color Palettes
**Create depth with gradients:**
- Primary gradient (not just solid primary color)
- Subtle background gradients
- Gradient text for headings
- Gradient borders on cards
- Dark mode with elevated surfaces

**Color usage:**
- 60-30-10 rule (dominant, secondary, accent)
- Consistent semantic colors (success, warning, error)
- Accessible contrast ratios (WCAG AA minimum)
- Test colors in both light and dark modes

### Typography
**Create hierarchy through contrast:**
- Large, bold headings (48-72px for heroes)
- Clear size differences between levels
- Variable font weights (300, 400, 600, 700)
- Letter spacing for small caps
- Line height 1.5-1.7 for body text
- Inter, Poppins, or DM Sans for modern feel

### Shadows & Depth
**Layer UI elements:**
- Multi-layer shadows for realistic depth
- Colored shadows matching element color
- Elevated states on hover
- Neumorphism for special elements (sparingly)
- Adjust shadow intensity based on theme (lighter in dark mode)

## Interactions & Micro-animations

### Button Interactions
**Every button should react:**
- Scale slightly on hover (1.02-1.05)
- Lift with shadow on hover
- Ripple effect on click
- Loading state with spinner or progress
- Disabled state clearly visible
- Success state with checkmark animation

### Card Interactions
**Make cards feel alive:**
- Lift on hover with increased shadow
- Subtle border glow on hover
- Tilt effect following mouse (3D transform)
- Smooth transitions (200-300ms)
- Click feedback for interactive cards

### Form Interactions
**Guide users through forms:**
- Input focus states with border color change
- Floating labels that animate up
- Real-time validation with inline messages
- Success checkmarks for valid inputs
- Error states with shake animation
- Password strength indicators
- Character count for text areas

### Page Transitions
**Smooth between views:**
- Fade + slide for page changes
- Skeleton loaders during data fetch
- Optimistic UI updates
- Stagger animations for lists
- Route transition animations

## Mobile Responsiveness

### Mobile-First Approach
**Design for mobile, enhance for desktop:**
- Touch targets minimum 44x44px
- Generous padding and spacing
- Sticky bottom navigation on mobile
- Collapsible sections for long content
- Swipeable cards and galleries
- Pull-to-refresh where appropriate

### Responsive Patterns
**Adapt layouts intelligently:**
- Hamburger menu → full nav bar
- Card grid → stack on mobile
- Sidebar → drawer
- Multi-column → single column
- Data tables → card list
- Hide/show elements based on viewport

---

---

## Loading & Empty States

### Loading States
**Never leave users wondering:**
- Skeleton screens matching content layout
- Progress bars for known durations
- Animated placeholders
- Spinners only for short waits (<3s)
- Stagger loading for multiple elements
- Shimmer effects on skeletons

### Empty States
**Make empty states helpful:**
- Illustrations or icons
- Helpful copy explaining why it's empty
- Clear CTA to add first item
- Examples or suggestions
- No "no data" text alone

---

---

## Consistency Rules

### Maintain Consistency
**What should stay consistent:**
- Spacing scale (4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px, 64px)
- Border radius values
- Animation timing (200ms, 300ms, 500ms)
- Color system (primary, secondary, accent, neutrals)
- Typography scale
- Icon style (outline vs filled)
- Button styles across the app
- Form element styles

### What Can Vary
**Project-specific customization:**
- Color palette (different colors, same system)
- Layout creativity (grids, asymmetry)
- Illustration style
- Animation personality
- Feature-specific interactions
- Hero section design
- Card styling variations
- Background patterns or textures

---

## Technical Excellence

### Performance
- Optimize images (WebP, lazy loading)
- Code splitting for faster loads
- Debounce search inputs
- Virtualize long lists
- Minimize re-renders
- Use proper memoization

### Accessibility
- Keyboard navigation throughout
- ARIA labels where needed
- Focus indicators visible
- Screen reader friendly
- Sufficient color contrast (both themes)
- Respect reduced motion preferences

## Key Principles

1. **Be Bold** - Don't be afraid to try unique layouts and interactions
2. **Be Consistent** - Use the same patterns for similar functions
3. **Be Responsive** - Design works beautifully on all devices
4. **Be Fast** - Animations are smooth, loading is quick
5. **Be Accessible** - Everyone can use what you build
6. **Be Modern** - Use current design trends and technologies
7. **Be Unique** - Each project should have its own personality
8. **Be Intuitive** - Users shouldn't need instructions
9. **Be Themeable** - Support both dark and light modes seamlessly
